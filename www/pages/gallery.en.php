Fursuits made by Wildspotworks

The following Gallery shows some examples of my recent work. Please note that this Gallery also features some body-only commissions which means I did not built every suit entirely. For more information about each suit just take a look at the dedicated page.

Further I really want to express my gratitude to the suit owners and their photographers of course, for providing me most of those beautiful pictures here!

            description: "<p>Hieroo the Kangaroo was finished in January 2022. It's the third kangaroo suit I had the pleasure building, and furthermore It was kinda an artistic liberty project with only a few design-directions. This made me a bit go crazy with the pattern because I thought having plain direct lines would be a bit boring. This doubled the actual sewing time but it, was worth it.</p><p>Hieroo on Furaffinity: <a href=\"https://www.furaffinity.net/user/hierohusky/\">Hierohusky</a><p>Photos by Cerberus</p>",
